 Due to the fact that we are a team of three, we have been requested to add 3 functionalities + 1 bonus if we would like to.
 
 additional functionality:
 1. Clock that increases game time by 10 seconds.
 2. Random appearance lolipop - increases score by 10 points.
 3. Two of the monsters are more powerfull than the others. one will damage -20 points (instead of -10) and 1 life, 
   and one will damage -30 ppoints and 2 lives.
 4. Medicine that will increase life by 2 additional lives. 

For smart monsters chace we used pure heuristics search applying manhattan distance heuristics.
